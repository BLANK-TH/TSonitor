STonitor is an application  with the same general goal as MSWS' [Sonitor](https://github.com/MSWS/Sonitor) program, to 
facilitate admining eGO TTT & JB servers, by automatically analyzing logs outputted by those
servers. It can also show you the account age and CS:GO playtime (if available) of Steam accounts on the server.

*Do not rely solely on this program to determine whether something was an infraction, all analyses are done with only
the round logs as context. It can't possibly interpret anything that happened in game, it can only work with the 
information provided to it.*
